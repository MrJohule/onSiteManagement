#On Site Management

Application to manage on site employees after COVID-19 pandemic. 

The purpose of this application is to let HR departments: 

- define sites, and restaurants.
- define what they want to track: arrivals, departures, lunch time slots, parkings,...
- fix limits on these features for each site (I do not want more than 25 peoples to arrive between 9.00 and 9.30, by instance).
- track usages, and availabilities.

After that, users can access the application, and declare their presence.
